Introduction
------------

SCINE autoCAS automates the crucial active-orbital-space selection step in multi-configurational calculations. Based on orbital entanglement
measures derived from an approximate DMRG wave function, it identifies all strongly correlated orbitals to be included in the active space
of a final, converged calculation. All steps can be carried out in a fully automated fashion.

Installation
------------

Currently autoCAS can be installed via pip or manually with git and pip (see sections below).

Basic Requirements
..................

AutoCAS utilizes a couple of third-party packages, which are defined in the ``requirements.txt``.

All requirements are automatically installed by installing autoCAS over one of the following methods.

pip
...

Prerequisites
``````````````

    #. python3.6+

Install
```````
This methods allows you to install the package via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install scine-autocas

Git + pip
.........

Prerequisites
``````````````

    #. git
    #. python3.6+

Install
```````
This methods requires you to first clone the repository and install the package over pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone <autocas-repo>
   cd autoCAS
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install .

Set up OpenMolcas
-----------------
Up to this point `OpenMolcas` does not provide any way to call itself from a native Python interfaces.
Hence, autoCAS calls `OpenMolcas` directly over `pymolcas`. In order to do so, please set the environment
variable `MOLCAS` pointing to the ``build`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   export MOLCAS=/path/to/Molcas/build

Quickstart
----------

After installing autoCAS it can be started from the command line. To show all possible options, please run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m scine_autocas -h

For example, autoCAS can be started by passing a valid XYZ file to it, and running all calculations with the corresponding defaults.

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m scine_autocas -x <molecule.xyz>

To pass a basis set, a different interface or enable the creation of entanglement diagrams
the following directives can be passed:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m scine_autocas --xyz_file <molecule.xyz> --basis_set cc-pvtz --plot --interface Molcas

However we would strongly recommend providing a ``.yml``-input file, to make calculations reproducible and
allowing higher customization of autoCAS.
